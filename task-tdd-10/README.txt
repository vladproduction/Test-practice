1 Solution of Task was built by design of template and factory patterns.
2 By that we have structure of the project to choose function in case of FunctionProcessor by type.
3 Each function was separate in certain package and contain FunctionProcessor class with private
variables and individual implementing of function method.
4 All methods I found as common implements in AbstractFunctionProcessor.
5 Tests
For tests I choose TestNG library.
Each function were testing with parameterized test methods in a bundle of StaticDataProviderClass.
By that we have parameters for tests.
6 Project was built by test driven development.
