What is stubbing in Mockito?
A stub is a fake class that comes with preprogrammed return values. It's injected into the class under test to give you
absolute control over what's being tested as input. A typical stub is a database connection that allows you to mimic any
scenario without having a real database.

"Strict stubbing" is a new feature in Mockito 2 that drives cleaner tests and better productivity. The easiest way to
leverage it is via Mockito's JUnit support ( MockitoJUnit ) or Mockito Session ( MockitoSession ). How strictness influences
the behavior of the test?
