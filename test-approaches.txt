JUnit, TestNG, and Mockito are popular frameworks in the Java ecosystem used for unit testing and test automation. 
Each of them serves a specific purpose in the testing process and can often be used in conjunction with one another. 
Here’s an overview of each framework, their features, and how they can be utilized.

1. JUnit
JUnit is a widely used testing framework for Java applications. It provides annotations to identify test methods and assertions to verify expected results. 
JUnit is particularly well-suited for unit testing.

Features:
Annotations: @Test, @Before, @After, etc., to define test methods and lifecycle methods.
Assertions: Methods like assertEquals(), assertTrue() to validate expected outcomes.
Test Runners: JUnit can run tests in various environments, including command-line and integrated development environments (IDEs).
Example of JUnit:
Here’s a simple example of a JUnit test case:

java

import org.junit.Assert;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;

public class CalculatorTest {

    private Calculator calculator;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        calculator = new Calculator();
    }

    @Test
    public void testAddition() {
        Assert.assertEquals(5, calculator.add(2, 3));
    }

    @Test
    public void testSubtraction() {
        Assert.assertEquals(1, calculator.subtract(3, 2));
    }
}

2. TestNG
TestNG is another testing framework that is similar to JUnit but provides additional features designed to cover a wider range of testing needs, such as integration testing and end-to-end testing.

Features:
Annotations: Similar to JUnit but more flexible; supports parallel test execution and more complex test configurations.
Data-driven Testing: Supports parameterized tests directly.
Flexible Test Configuration: Test groups, dependencies, and suites.
Test Reporting: Generates detailed test reports.
Example of TestNG:
Here’s an example of a TestNG test case:

java

import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.BeforeMethod;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class CalculatorTestNG {

    private Calculator calculator;

    @BeforeMethod
    public void setUp() {
        calculator = new Calculator();
    }

    @Test
    public void testAddition() {
        Assert.assertEquals(calculator.add(2, 3), 5);
    }

    @Test
    public void testSubtraction() {
        Assert.assertEquals(calculator.subtract(3, 2), 1);
    }
}

3. Mockito
Mockito is a mocking framework that allows you to create mock objects in your tests. 
This is particularly useful when testing classes that depend on other classes or external systems, allowing you to isolate the unit under test.

Features:
Mock Objects: Create mock instances of classes/interfaces.
Stubbing: Define behavior for methods in your mock objects.
Verification: Verify that certain interactions occurred on your mock objects.
Integration: Works seamlessly with JUnit and TestNG.
Example of Mockito:
Here’s how you can use Mockito for unit testing:

java

import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.mockito.Mockito;

import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

public class UserServiceTest {

    private UserRepository userRepository;
    private UserService userService;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        userRepository = mock(UserRepository.class);
        userService = new UserService(userRepository);
    }

    @Test
    public void testSaveUser() {
        User user = new User("Alice");

        userService.saveUser(user);
        
        // Verify that the save method was called on the mock
        verify(userRepository).save(user);
    }
}

Conclusion
JUnit is primarily focused on unit testing with a simple approach.
TestNG is more versatile, catering to a broader range of testing needs, including integration and functional testing.
Mockito complements the testing frameworks by providing powerful tools for mocking dependencies, allowing developers to isolate the components during testing.
Together, these frameworks provide a robust environment for testing Java applications, enabling developers to ensure the quality and correctness of their code.
